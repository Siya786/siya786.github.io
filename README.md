## ***Sir imparted their golden words by enumerating all the following ideals:-*** ##
 - The influence of **DESTINY** in transforming an aimless life into one with a meaningful purpose, helping us realize that life is indeed worth living.
- The essential principle of **CHANGE** and **GROWTH.**
- 'I' plays an important role in our life,only **I** can facilitate my own change and growth if I am determined enough."
- ***Hearbeat is the best music***. It is the finest tune when you listen to your heart the path ahead in your career will naturally clear of all obstacles
- sir also talked about the **one min concept** that every min is important in our life and how we utilise this time in a good way for making our future best.Participants were asked to close their eyes and observe one minute of silence before opening them. There was a noticeable difference in the timing of when each person chose to open their eyes. This variability stemmed from each individual's unique management of their 60 seconds: some opened their eyes quickly, while others opted to keep them closed for the entire duration. This exercise effectively demonstrated differing perspectives on **time management** among the group.
